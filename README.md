# Linear-regression-model
The model is a supervised learning model used for classification tasks. It's trained to predict whether an email is spam or not. After training the model on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. It is used to predict the classes of a test set

The Spambase dataset was a good choice for email spam classification because it has a balanced distribution of spam and non-spam emails, with about 40% of the emails being spam. The dataset also has a high dimensionality,  The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or from Kaggle..
